# Find A Farmer

Find A Farmer is designed for those in Middle TN who want to address the 
environmental issues around food waste, but for any number of reasons 
cannot compost some, or any of their food waste. It will share the 
locations of farmers who (1) opted in to the program and (2) have pigs 
that can eat just about anything. The environmentally savvy users will 
have the option to feed their waste to the pigs, thus keeping food waste 
from going to landfills, while helping the farmer supply the pigs with a 
nutritious diet.

## Table of Contents

## Project Requirements and Features List

When a user registers an account, or logs in from a previously registered
account, they are shown a list of all of the farms in the Middle TN area
that have opted into Find A Farmer. The are given the option to find a farm
in their preferred county, and then shown a list of only farms in that area.
They can then choose an individual farm to learn more about.

## Farm Details

When the user has selected a farm, they are shown the farm's address, the
instructions provided for dropping off their food waste, a list of items 
they are welcome to include, and a list of items they are asked to exclude.
They are given reviews for that farm, listed from most recent to least 
recent, and the option to add their own review. Last, they are also given 
the option to go back to the list of all of the farms.

## Farm Review

When the user has clicked on the 'Add Review' button (on either the farm
details page, or from the list of farms), they are taken to a form that
allows them to write their own review. The title of the review includes
the name of the farm, so they can confirm they're reviewing the correct
farm. They are asked to give their review a title, the date they visited,
and the review itself. Once they submit their review, they are redirected
to the details page of the farm they have just reviewed.

### Development Tools
















# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
