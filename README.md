# Find A Farmer

Find A Farmer is designed for those in Middle TN who want to address the 
environmental issues around food waste, but for any number of reasons 
cannot compost some, or any of their food waste. It will share the 
locations of farmers who (1) opted in to the program and (2) have pigs 
that can eat just about anything. The environmentally savvy users will 
have the option to feed their waste to the pigs, thus keeping food waste 
from going to landfills, while helping the farmer supply the pigs with a 
nutritious diet.

## Project Requirements and Features List
### Two Types of Users

Users are offered two registration options. If they are not a farmer, they
register with just their name, username, email, profile picture and zip code.
As a farmer, they also are required to fill out information on their farm,
including the address, website (if applicable), and their farm's name.

### Get Started
When a user registers an account, or logs in from a previously registered
account, they are shown a list of all of the farms in the Middle TN area
that have opted into Find A Farmer. The are given the option to find a farm
in their preferred county, and then shown a list of only farms in that area.
They can then choose an individual farm to learn more about.

### Farm Details
When the user has selected a farm, they are shown the farm's address, the
instructions provided for dropping off their food waste, a list of items 
they are welcome to include, and a list of items they are asked to exclude.
They are given reviews for that farm, listed from most recent to least 
recent, and the option to add their own review. Last, they are also given 
the option to go back to the list of all of the farms.

### Farm Review
When the user has clicked on the 'Add Review' button (on either the farm
details page, or from the list of farms), they are taken to a form that
allows them to write their own review. The title of the review includes
the name of the farm, so they can confirm they're reviewing the correct
farm. They are asked to give their review a title, the date they visited,
and the review itself. Once they submit their review, they are redirected
to the details page of the farm they have just reviewed.

### Edit and Delete Review
Users are given the option to edit or delete the reviews that they have
written.
